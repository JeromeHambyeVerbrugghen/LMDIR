## Introduction

Log-mean divisia index (LMDI) decomposition analysis is an important technique 
for understanding causes of changes in an energy composite over time.
The technique was pioneered by B.W. Ang and is described in detail in
[Ang [-@Ang:2005]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2003.10.010).
LMDI decomposes an energy aggregate by factors and categories.

[Heun and Brockway [-@Heun:2019]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.255) developed a matrix representation
of the LMDI mathematics that works well with the 
Physical Supply Use Table (PSUT) framework
developed by [Heun et al. [-@Heun:2018]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.05.109).
This vignette describes 
and provides examples for
the matrix method for LMDI decomposition analysis. 
This vignette is a version of Section S3 of the Supplemental Information to 
[Heun and Brockway [-@Heun:2019]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.255).


## Description of the matrix method for LMDI decomposition analysis

The LMDI approach pioneered by [Ang et al. [-@Ang:1998]](https://doi.org/10.1016/s0360-5442(98)00016-4)
and described in detail by [Liu and Ang [-@Liu:2003]](https://doi.org/10.1016/s0306-2619(03)00043-6)
decomposes an energy aggregate ($V$) by factors ($x$)
that cause $V$ to change over time. 
(In this vignette, we adopt the notation of [Ang [-@Ang:2005]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2003.10.010).)

Noting that at a given time every combination of energy category ($i$) and decomposition factor ($j$)
has an associated numerical value for the decomposition factor ($x_{ij}$),
the matrix approach to LMDI decomposition analysis begins with formation of an $\mat{X}$ matrix
for each time of interest.
Rows of $\mat{X}$ contain energy categories (indexed by $i$) of the aggregate ($V$) and 
columns of $\mat{X}$ contain decomposition factors (indexed by $j$).

Column vector $\colvec{v}$ contains 
the value of each energy category ($v_i$)
and is formed from row products of $\mat{X}$. 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:v}
  v_i = \prod_j x_{ij}
\end{equation}

At any given time, the energy aggregate ($V$) is obtained by 
the column sum of elements in the $\colvec{v}$ vector

\begin{equation} \label{eq:V}
  V = \rowvec{i} \colvec{v} \; ,
\end{equation}

where $\colvec{i}$ is a column vector of 1's (an identity vector) of same size as $\colvec{v}$.

Additive ($\Delta V$) and multiplicative ($D$) changes in the energy aggregate ($V$)
between two adjacent times,
an initial time (superscript $0$) and a later time (superscript $T$),
are calculated by

\begin{equation} \label{eq:deltaV_def}
  \Delta V = V^T - V^0 \; ,
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation} \label{eq:D_def}
  D = \frac{V^T}{V^0} \; .
\end{equation}

A $\mat{Z}$ matrix is formed for two adjacent times by

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Z_eqn_element_notation}
  Z_{ij} = \frac{v_i^T - v_i^0}{\ln \left( \frac{v_i^T}{v_i^0}\right)} 
            \ln \left( \frac{x_{ij}^T}{x_{ij}^0} \right) ,
\end{equation}

with care taken to address the zero-value problem noted by 
[Ang et al. [-@Ang:1998]](https://doi.org/10.1016/s0360-5442(98)00016-4)
in Table 2
and discussed at length by 
[Wood and Lenzen [-@Wood:2006]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2004.11.010).

Given the $\mat{Z}$ matrix defined by the equation for $Z_{ij}$ above,
a $\Delta \mat{v}$ vector is calculated by column sums of $\mat{Z}$

\begin{equation} \label{eq:deltaV_eqn}
  \Delta \mat{V} = \rowvec{i} \mat{Z} \; ,
\end{equation}

where entries in $\Delta \mat{V}$ give the additive contribution 
of the $j^\mathrm{th}$ decomposition factor 
to changes in $V$ from time $0$ to time $T$.

Multiplicative decomposition is obtained with the $\mat{D}$ row vector calculated by

\begin{equation} \label{eq:D_eqn}
  D_j = \exp \left( \frac{\Delta V_j}{\frac{V^T - V^0}{\ln \frac{V^T}{V^0}}} \right) \; ,
\end{equation}

where entries in $\mat{D}$ give the multiplicative contribution 
of the $j^\mathrm{th}$ decomposition factor 
to changes in $V$ from time $0$ to time $T$.

Verification can be performed by 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:deltaV_check}
   \Delta \mat{V} \colvec{i} \overset{?}{=} V^T - V^0 \; ,
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation} \label{eq:D_check}
   \prod_j D_j \overset{?}{=} \frac{V^T}{V^0}\; .
\end{equation}

Cumulative changes in $V$ over many time periods can be calculated by 
cumulative sums of the $\Delta \mat{V}$ row vector for additive decomposition and by
cumulative products of the $\mat{D}$ row vector for multiplicative decomposition.


## Application of the matrix method to energy conversion chain (ECC) analysis

An energy conversion chain (ECC) is a set of
energy carriers, 
energy transformation devices, and 
energy services 
within spatial and temporal boundaries of interest.
For the purposes of this vignette, an ECC comprises 
primary, final, and useful energy and exergy flowing through society.

Following 
[Brockway et al. [-@Brockway:2015aa]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.05.082),
one energy aggregate from an ECC is total useful exergy supplied to the economy ($X_u$).
$X_u$ is comprised of 
subcategories ($sc$, Heat, Electric, Mechanical Drive (Petroleum), and Muscle Work)
and
subsubcategories ($ssc$, such as KE--Fans and MD--Tractors).
The decomposition factors are given in the following table.

| factor   | description
|-:|:----------------
| $X_p$           | Total primary exergy supplied to the economy
| $\phi_{p,sc}$   | Allocation ratio of primary exergy ($p$) to subcategory ($sc$) (Heat, Electric, Mechanical drive, Muscle work)
| $\phi_{sc,ssc}$ | Allocation ratio of exergy from subcategory ($sc)$ to subsubcategory ($ssc$) (MD - Diesel trains, Electric lights, etc.)
| $\eta_{ssc}$    | Primary-to-useful thermodynamic efficiency of subsubcategory ($ssc$)

In equation form, the energy aggregate ($X_u$) is calculated by

\begin{equation} \label{eq:X_u_eqn}
  X_u = \sum_{ssc} X_{u,ssc} \; ,
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation} \label{eq:X_u_i_eqn}
  X_{u,ssc} = X_{p,tot} \phi_{p,sc} \phi_{sc,ssc} \eta_{ssc}
      = X_{p,tot} \frac{X_{sc}}{X_{p,tot}} \frac{X_{ssc}}{X_{sc}} \frac{X_{u,ssc}}{X_{p,ssc}} \; .
\end{equation}

Note that $X_{p,ssc}$ is the embodied primary exergy 
of the useful exergy produced by the subsubcategory ($X_{u,ssc}$).


## Simple example

To demonstrate the matrix approach to LMDI decomposition analysis,
we begin with a simple example that is 
small enough to allow 
replication of the results by hand calculations 
if desired  
but sufficient detail to illustrate features of the calculations.

A data frame of $\mat{X}$ matrices is the starting point for a simple example.
The example has two fictitious countries (`AB` and `YZ`) and
covers four years (1971--1974).
Countries `AB` and `YZ` are identical for the purposes of illustration.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(LMDIR)
library(magrittr)
library(matsbyname)
library(matsindf)
library(tidyr)
DF <- create_simple_LMDI()
DF
```

For the remainder of these examples, 
only the first four rows will be shown.
(Rows 5--8 for country `YZ` are the same as rows 1--4 for country `AB`.)

The `X` column of the data frame contains $\mat{X}$ matrices.
The $\mat{X}$ matrices contain all the information about energy categories and factors.
The $\mat{X}$ matrices are all that is needed to perform the LMDI analysis.

```{r}
DF[1:4, ]$X
```

To see how the factors affect the aggregate over time, 
we can perform the LMDI decomposition analysis.
But we first group by `Country` to ensure that each `Country` will be 
treated separately.
(`lmdi()` respects grouping.)

```{r}
res <- DF %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  lmdi()
```

The result of the call to `lmdi()` is `DF` with additional columns.

```{r}
glimpse(res)
```

Each additional column provides results of the LMDI analysis.
Both additive and multiplicative results are provided.

The `V` column contains aggregates ($V$),
with the first year assigned a value of `0`.

```{r} 
res$V %>% unlist()
```

The `Z` column contains $\mat{Z}$ matrices,
with the first year assigned a value of `1`.

```{r}
res[1:4, ]$Z
```

Note that calculating the entries in the $\mat{Z}$ matrices requires
evaluating 8 degenerate cases as shown in Table 2, p. 492 of
[Ang et al. [-@Ang:1998]](https://doi.org/10.1016/s0360-5442(98)00016-4).
Evaluation of the 8 degenerate cases is performed by the `Zij()` function.

```{r}
Zij
```

The `dV_agg` column contains year-to-year differences in the aggregate ($V$).

```{r}
res[1:4, ]$dV_agg %>% unlist()
```

The `D_agg` column contains year-to-year ratios of the aggregate ($V$).

```{r}
res$D_agg %>% unlist()
```

The `dV` column contains $\colvec{\Delta V}$ vectors.

```{r}
res[1:4, ]$dV
```

The `D` column contains $\colvec{D}$ vectors.

```{r}
res[1:4, ]$D
```

The remaining columns have the `_cum` suffix and represent cumulative values.
The `dV_agg_cum` column gives cumulative differences in the aggregate ($V$) relative to the first time.

```{r}
res$dV_agg_cum %>% unlist()
```

The `D_agg_cum` column gives cumulative ratios of the aggregate ($V$) relative to the first time.

```{r}
res$D_agg_cum %>% unlist()
```

The `dV_cum` column gives the cumulative differences in the $\colvec{\Delta V}$ vectors
relative to the first time.

```{r}
res[1:4, ]$dV_cum
```

The `D_cum` column gives the cumulative ratios of the $\colvec{D}$ vectors
relative to the first time.

```{r}
res[1:4, ]$D_cum
```


## Realistic example (Ghana)

The objective of this analysis is to discern the drivers of changes
to useful exergy supplied to the Ghanaian economy over time,
expressed in multiplicative form. 
To achieve this objective, we will perform and report results of an
LMDI analysis of the Ghanaian energy conversion chain. 
This analysis also serves to demonstrate the use of the LMDIR package with data 
from a real energy conversion chain.

We'll use data from [Heun and Brockway [-@Heun:2019]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.255)
for exergy flows through Ghanaian society.
The data frame consists of annual $\mat{X}$ matrices for Ghana over the period 1971--2013.
This data frame is available as `LMDIR::XGH`.

```{r}
glimpse(XGH)
```

Each $\mat{X}$ matrix contains 
useful exergy subsubcategories (in rows)
and factors (in columns)
as shown below for Ghana for 2003 and 2004.

```{r}
prettifyXZ <- function(XZ){
  out <- XZ %>% 
    sort_rows_cols(roworder = c(
      # Heat categories (phi_i = 0.622)
      "HTH.600.C - Electric heaters", "MTH.100.C - Charcoal stoves",
      "MTH.100.C - Kerosene stoves", "MTH.100.C - LPG stoves",
      "MTH.100.C - Wood stoves",
      # Electricity categories (phi_i = 0.020)
      "KE - Fans", "Light - Electric lights",
      "Light - Televisions", "LTH.-10.C - Refrigerators",
      "MD - Electric motors", "MD - Other appliances",
      "MTH.100.C - Electric heaters", "MTH.200.C - Irons",
      "MTH.200.C - Electric heaters",
      # Liquid petroleum categories (phi_i = 0.131)
      "MD - Boat engines", "MD - Diesel cars",
      "MD - Diesel trains", "MD - Industry static diesel engines",
      "MD - Petrol cars", "MD - Tractors",
      # Food and feed categories (phi_i = 0.226)
      "MD - Draught animals", "MD - Manual laborers"),
      colorder = c("EXp.ktoe", "phi_i", "phi_ij", "eta_ij"))
  out[ , "EXp.ktoe"] <-  round(out[ , "EXp.ktoe"], 1)
  out[ , "phi_i"]    <-  round(out[ , "phi_i"], 3)
  out[ , "phi_ij"]   <-  round(out[ , "phi_ij"], 3)
  out[ , "eta_ij"]   <-  round(out[ , "eta_ij"], 3)
  return(out)
}
XGH %>% 
  filter(Year == 2003) %>% 
  extract2("X") %>% 
  extract2(1) %>% 
  prettifyXZ()
XGH %>% 
  filter(Year == 2004) %>% 
  extract2("X") %>% 
  extract2(1) %>% 
  prettifyXZ()
```

Note that row and column ordering is provided for readability.
The ordered rows show identical values of $\phi_i$
for allocation to the subcategories of
Heat, Electricity, Mechanical drive (fueled by petroleum), and 
Muscle work (fueled by food and feed).
Column order follows flows of energy and exergy through the economy,
from primary stage to allocation to subcategories
through allocation to subsubcategories and, finally, to 
a primary-to-useful efficiency for each task.
All unique $\phi_i$ values sum to 1.
(Specifically for 2003, 0.519 + 0.081 + 0.188 + 0.212 = 1.)
Within each subcategory, $\phi_{ij}$ values sum to 1.
(E.g., for Mechanical drive fueled by food and feed, 0.789 + 0.211 = 1)


### Perform the LMDI decomposition analysis

To perform LMDI decomposition analysis, we use the `lmdi()` function after grouping on metadata variables
(in this case, only `Country`).

```{r}
fillrowX <- matrix(c(1, 1, 0, 1), byrow = TRUE, nrow = 1, ncol = 4,
                   dimnames = list("row", 
                                   c("EXp.ktoe", "phi_i", "phi_ij", "eta_ij")))
GHlmdi <- XGH %>% 
  group_by(Country) %>% 
  lmdi(fillrow = list(fillrowX))
glimpse(GHlmdi)
```

(The need for and values in `fillrowX` are described below.)


### A note about special cases for calculating entires in $\mat{Z}$

When a category of useful exergy is present in one year
but absent in an adjacent year, 
the corresponding row in $\mat{X}^0$ or $\mat{X}^T$ is missing compared to the other.
That happened in Ghana between 2003 and 2004;
in 2003, VALCO's aluminum smelters were operating, but in 2004 they were not.
Thus, we treat the `HTH.600.C - Electric heaters` row specially in 2004. 

For 2004, we insert a row for `HTH.600.C - Electric Heaters` and fill it 
with positive numbers for
primary exergy ($X_{p,tot}$ or `EXp,ktoe`),
allocation from primary exergy to subcategory ($\phi_{p,sc}$ or `phi_i`), and
thermodynamic efficiency ($\eta_{ssc}$ or `eta_ij`).
(The fill values are irrelevant to the calculated result,
so long as they are positive numbers.)
We set the allocation from subcategory to subsubcategory ($\phi_{sc,ssc}$ or `phi_ij`) to `0`.
This approach reflects the reality that
despite the fact that there is no useful exergy of this type in 2004,
we still have total primary exergy ($X_{p,tot}$),
there is still an allocation of primary exergy 
to the subcategory `Heat` ($\phi_{p,sc} \neq 0$), and
if there were electric heaters making `HTH.600.C - Electric heaters` in this year, 
they would have done so with a non-zero thermodynamic efficiency ($\eta_{ssc}$).

```{r}
XGH %>% 
  filter(Year == 2004) %>% 
  extract2("X") %>% 
  extract2(1) %>% 
  sum_byname(fillrowX) %>% 
  prettifyXZ()
```

`fillrowX` triggers special calculation of $\mat{Z}$ values for 2004.
When  
$X_{p,tot} > 0$, 
$\phi_{p,sc} > 0$, 
$\eta_{ssc} > 0$, 
and $\phi_{sc,ssc} = 0$, 
we employ Table 2, Row 2 
of [Ang et al. [-@Ang:1998]](https://doi.org/10.1016/s0360-5442(98)00016-4)
to calculate `Z[HTH.600.C - Electric heaters, phi_ij] = -6.416`, 
as shown below.
The other values on the row are `0.0`.
(If this example were switched in time such that the smelters 
were not used in 2003 but turned \emph{on} in 2004,
we would employ Table 2, Row 1 
of [Ang et al. [-@Ang:1998]](https://doi.org/10.1016/s0360-5442(98)00016-4).)

```{r}
GHlmdi %>% 
  filter(Year == 2004) %>% 
  extract2("Z") %>% 
  extract2(1) %>%
  prettifyXZ()
```


### Presentation of results

The `GHlmdi` object contains everything needed to present the results. 
The focus here is on the ratioed aggregate (`D_agg_cum`) and disaggregate (`D_cum`)
factors that affect changes in useful exergy delivered to the economy.
So we first need to expand the data from matrices to tidy format and
select the desired columns.

```{r}
GHlmdi_tidy <- GHlmdi %>% 
  select(Country, Year, D_agg_cum, D_cum) %>% 
  gather(key = matnames, value = matvals, -Country, -Year) %>% 
  expand_to_tidy() %>% 
  select(-colnames, -rowtypes, -coltypes)
head(GHlmdi_tidy, 10)
```

Next, we map the values of `matnames` and `rownames` 
to variable names appropriate for graphing, according to the table below.

| graph variable | factor | description
|-:|:-:|:---------------
| D~tot~ |                 | Total change in useful exergy
| D~ex~  | $X_p$           | Primary exergy supplied to the economy
| D~str~ | $\phi_{p,sc}$   | Allocation of primary exergy ($p$) to subcategory ($sc$) (Heat, Electric, Mechanical drive, Muscle work) or main class structural change
| D~eff~ | $\eta_{ssc}$    | Primary-to-useful thermodynamic efficiency of subsubcategory ($ssc$)
| D~dil~ | $\phi_{sc,ssc}$ | Allocation ratio of exergy from subcategory ($sc)$ to subsubcategory ($ssc$) (MD - Diesel trains, Electric lights, etc.) or subclass structural change

We also set the levels of the `Factor`s,
and thereby the order in which they will appear in the legend of the graph.
We choose an order that reflects the vertical positioning of the lines on the graph.

```{r}
GHlmdi_forgraphing <- GHlmdi_tidy %>% 
  mutate(
    Factor = case_when(
      matnames == "D_agg_cum" ~ "D_tot", 
      rownames == "EXp.ktoe" ~ "D_ex",
      rownames == "eta_ij" ~ "D_eff", 
      rownames == "phi_i"  ~ "D_str", 
      rownames == "phi_ij" ~ "D_dil" 
    ), 
    Factor = factor(Factor, levels = c("D_tot", "D_ex", "D_str", "D_eff", "D_dil"))
  ) %>% 
  rename(
    value = matvals
  ) %>% 
  select(-rownames, -matnames) %>% 
  group_by(Country, Factor)
head(GHlmdi_forgraphing, 10)
```

Finally, we create a graph showing both the total changes ($D_{tot}$) and 
the multiplicative factors that comprise the total change
($D_{ex}$, $D_{str}$, $D_{eff}$, and $D_{dil}$).

```{r graph, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 4, fig.retina = 2}
GHlmdi_forgraphing %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Year, y = value, linetype = Factor)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1, colour = "gray50", size = 0.1) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Cumulative changes relative to 1971 [-]", linetype = NULL, colour = NULL) +
  scale_linetype_manual(values = c("D_tot" = 1, "D_ex" = 5, "D_str" = 2, "D_dil" = 6, "D_eff" = 3),
                        labels = c("D_tot" = expression(D[tot]), 
                                   "D_ex"  = expression(D[ex]), 
                                   "D_str" = expression(D[str]), 
                                   "D_dil" = expression(D[dil]), 
                                   "D_eff" = expression(D[eff]))
  )
```

Note that the graph above is the same as Figure 7 of 
[Heun and Brockway [-@Heun:2019]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.255).


## Conclusion

The `LMDIR` package provides a convenient and powerful capability
for log-mean divisia index
decomposition analysis of energy conversion chains
expressed as Physical Supply Use Table (PSUT) matrices.
