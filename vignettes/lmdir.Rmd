## Introduction

Log-mean divisia index (LMDI) decomposition analysis is an important technique 
for understanding changes in an energy composite variable over time.
The technique was pioneered by B.W. Ang and is described in detail in
[Ang [-@Ang:2005]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2003.10.010).
LMDI decomposes an energy aggregate by factors and subcategories.

[Heun and Brockway [-@Heun:2019]](https://doi.org/) developed a matrix representation
of the LMDI mathematics that works well with the 
Physical Supply Use Table (PSUT) framework, 
developed by [Heun et al. [-@Heun:2018]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.05.109).

We begin with a general description of the matrix method for LMDI analysis.
Thereafter, we illustrate the method by application to Ghana
in years 2003--2004.

## Description of the matrix method for LMDI decomposition analysis

The LMDI approach pioneered by [Ang [-@Ang:1998]](https://doi.org/10.1016/s0360-5442(98)00016-4)
and described in detail by Liu~\cite{Liu:2003}
decomposes an energy aggregate~($V$) by factors~($x$)
that cause $V$ to change over time. 
(In this appendix, we adopt the notation of a later paper \cite{Ang:2005}.)
