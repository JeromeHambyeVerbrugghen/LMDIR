\title{Z matrix from \code{X_0} and \code{X_T} matrices}
\usage{
Z_byname(X_0, X_T, fillrow = NULL, weights = c("LMDI-I", "LMDI-II"))
}
\arguments{
\item{X_0}{an \code{X} matrix for initial time \code{0}}

\item{X_T}{an \code{X} matrix for final time \code{T}}

\item{fillrow}{a row vector of type \code{matrix} with column names identical
to \code{X_0} and \code{X_T}. (See details.)}

\item{weights}{the name of the weights type chosen for the LMDI calculations.
\code{weights} should be one of "LMDI-I" or "LMDI-II". Default is "LMDI-I".}
}
\value{
A \code{Z} list of matrices for LMDI-I and LMDI-II weights.
}
\description{
The formula for \code{Z} is
\deqn{Z_ij = logmean(v_Ti1, v_0i1) * log(X_Tij / X_0ij)}
where \code{v} is a column vector formed by row products of \code{X}.
The \code{0} and \code{T} subscripts on \code{X} and \code{v} indicate an initial time (\code{0})
and a final time (\code{T}).
The \code{i} and \code{j} subscripts on \code{Z}, \code{v}, and \code{X} are
matrix indices.
}
\details{
\code{Z} and \code{X} are category-by-factor matrices, and
\code{v} is a category-by-1 column vector.

When a category comes and goes through time,
the category row can be absent from the \code{X} matrix at one time
but present in the \code{X} matrix at an adjacent time.
If the missing category row is replaced by \code{0}s,
the LMDI algorithm fails due to \code{log(0)} errors.
The usual advice is to insert a row consisting not of \code{0}s
but rather filled with small numbers (e.g., \code{1e-10}).

But the usual advice doesn't represent reality for some LMDI decomposition analyses.
For example, the missing row may be caused by only one of the many factors being zero,
the other factors being non-zero.
To provide greater flexibility, this function provides the \code{fillrow} argument.
Callers can supply their own \code{fillrow},
a single-row \code{matrix} with column names identical
to \code{X_0} and \code{X_T}.
If \code{fillrow} is not specified,
the usual advice will be followed, and
a row vector consisting of very small values (\code{1e-10})
for each factor will be inserted into
\code{X_0} or \code{X_T}, as appropriate.

Note that the \code{\link[=lmdi]{lmdi()}} function passes its \code{fillrow} argument, if present,
to \code{Z_byname}.

The nomenclature for this function comes from
\href{\doi{10.1016/s0360-5442(98)00016-4}}{Ang, Zhang, and Choi (1998)}.
This function fully accounts for the degenerate cases
found in Table 2, p. 492 of
\href{\doi{10.1016/s0360-5442(98)00016-4}}{Ang, Zhang, and Choi (1998)}.
When \code{0}s are encountered in \code{emptyrow},
this function employs the method for dealing with the \code{log(0)} problem suggested by
\href{\doi{10.1016/j.enpol.2004.11.010}}{Wood and Lenzen (2006)}.
